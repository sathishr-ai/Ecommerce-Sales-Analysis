# 🛒 E-Commerce Sales Analysis Using Python & Machine Learning

This project analyzes **over 1,200 e-commerce transactions** to uncover insights about **sales trends, customer behavior, and delivery performance**.  
It combines **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to predict **late deliveries** and improve operational efficiency.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Understand e-commerce **sales patterns** and **customer purchase behavior**
- Identify **key performance indicators (KPIs)** such as revenue, profit, and delivery delays
- Visualize important business insights using **data visualization techniques**
- Build a **Random Forest Model** to predict whether a delivery will be late

---

## ⚙️ Key Steps

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** — Handle missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — Understand relationships between sales, profit, and delivery.  
3. **KPI Calculation** — Compute metrics like revenue, profit, and number of late deliveries.  
4. **Data Visualization** — Use Seaborn & Matplotlib to uncover sales and delivery trends.  
5. **Model Building** — Train a Random Forest Classifier to predict late deliveries.  
6. **Model Evaluation** — Evaluate accuracy, precision, and recall.
