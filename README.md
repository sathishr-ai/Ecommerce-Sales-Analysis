🛒 E-Commerce Sales Analysis Using Python & Machine Learning

This project analyzes over 1,200 e-commerce transactions to uncover insights about sales trends, customer behavior, and delivery performance.
It combines Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict late deliveries and improve operational efficiency.

📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
Understand e-commerce sales patterns and customer purchase behavior
Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, profit, and delivery delays
Visualize important business insights using data visualization techniques
Build a Random Forest Model to predict whether a delivery will be late

⚙️ Key Steps
Data Loading & Cleaning — Handle missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Understand relationships between sales, profit, and delivery.
KPI Calculation — Compute metrics like revenue, profit, and number of late deliveries.
Data Visualization — Use Seaborn & Matplotlib to uncover sales and delivery trends.
Model Building — Train a Random Forest Classifier to predict late deliveries.
Model Evaluation — Evaluate accuracy, precision, and recall.

🧰 Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Pandas, NumPy — Data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib, Seaborn — Data visualization
Scikit-Learn — Machine learning and predictive modeling
Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook — Development environment
