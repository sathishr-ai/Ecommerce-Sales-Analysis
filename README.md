# 🛒 E-Commerce Sales Analysis Using Python & Machine Learning

This project analyzes *over 1,200 e-commerce transactions* to uncover insights about *sales trends, customer behavior, and delivery performance*.  
It combines *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* and *Machine Learning (ML)* techniques to predict *late deliveries* and improve operational efficiency.


## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Understand e-commerce *sales patterns* and *customer purchase behavior*
- Identify *key performance indicators (KPIs)* such as revenue, profit, and delivery delays
- Visualize important business insights using *data visualization techniques*
- Build a *Random Forest Model* to predict whether a delivery will be late

## ⚙ Key Steps
1. *Data Loading & Cleaning* — Handle missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers.  
2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* — Understand relationships between sales, profit, and delivery.  
3. *KPI Calculation* — Compute metrics like revenue, profit, and number of late deliveries.  
4. *Data Visualization* — Use Seaborn & Matplotlib to uncover sales and delivery trends.  
5. *Model Building* — Train a Random Forest Classifier to predict late deliveries.  
6. *Model Evaluation* — Evaluate accuracy, precision, and recall.  

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- *Python 3.x*
- *Pandas, **NumPy* — Data manipulation and analysis
- *Matplotlib, **Seaborn* — Data visualization
- *Scikit-Learn* — Machine learning and predictive modeling
- *Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook* — Development environment
